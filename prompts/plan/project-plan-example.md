## Example Resilience Scenarios to Address

### LLM API Integration
- Rate limit exceeded â†’ Exponential backoff retry
- Model temporarily unavailable â†’ Circuit breaker with fallback model
- Authentication error â†’ No retry, immediate failure
- Timeout â†’ Retry with increased timeout
- Service overloaded â†’ Circuit breaker with degraded response

### Database Operations
- Connection timeout â†’ Retry with connection pool refresh
- Deadlock detected â†’ Retry with randomized delay
- Connection pool exhausted â†’ Circuit breaker with in-memory fallback
- Primary database down â†’ Automatic failover to read replica

### Third-Party APIs
- 429 Rate Limited â†’ Respect retry-after header
- 502/503 Service Unavailable â†’ Exponential backoff retry
- 401 Unauthorized â†’ No retry, refresh credentials
- Network timeout â†’ Retry with progressive timeout increase
- Service deprecated â†’ Circuit breaker with alternative service

### WebSocket Connection Scenarios
- Connection dropped â†’ Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- Authentication expired â†’ Re-authenticate and reconnect
- Message delivery failure â†’ Queue and retry with acknowledgment
- Server overloaded â†’ Circuit breaker with graceful degradation
- Network partition â†’ Local state preservation and sync on reconnect

### Secret Management Scenarios
- Secret rotation required â†’ Zero-downtime secret update
- Secret provider unavailable â†’ Fallback to cached secrets with TTL
- Secret validation failure â†’ Immediate alert and fallback strategy
- Unauthorized secret access â†’ Audit log and deny with notification
- Secret expired â†’ Automatic renewal or manual intervention alert

### Advanced Integration Scenarios
- Service discovery failure â†’ Fallback to static configuration
- Hot-reload configuration change â†’ Gradual rollout with health checks
- Service version incompatibility â†’ Automatic fallback to compatible version
- Load balancer failure â†’ Direct service communication with circuit breaker
- Multi-tenant resource exhaustion â†’ Isolation and throttling per tenant

Your architecture plan should demonstrate how to handle these scenarios systematically and configurably.
