## Implementation Strategy Analysis

### Recommended Approach: Phased Implementation

**Why Phases Are Better:**

1. **Complexity Management**: This is a complex system with multiple interdependent components. Phases allow for:
   - Incremental validation of each component
   - Early feedback and course correction
   - Reduced risk of integration failures
   - Easier debugging and testing

2. **Dependencies**: The phases have clear dependencies:
   - Phase 1 (Transcript Ingestion) must be completed before Phase 2 (MCP Server)
   - Phase 2 must be completed before Phase 3 (Agent System)
   - Phases 3-4 can be developed in parallel after Phase 2

3. **Testing and Validation**: Each phase can be tested independently:
   - Phase 1: Test transcript parsing and storage
   - Phase 2: Test MCP server and tool functionality
   - Phase 3: Test agent personas with mock data
   - Phase 4: Test evaluation framework with mock agents

4. **Risk Mitigation**: Phases allow for:
   - Early identification of technical challenges
   - Validation of approach before full implementation
   - Ability to pivot if certain approaches don't work

### Suggested Phase Breakdown for Cursor Implementation:

**Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)**
- Implement transcript ingestion system
- Create knowledge base infrastructure
- Set up data models and storage

**Phase 2: MCP Server (Week 2)**
- Implement stakeholder views MCP server
- Create search and retrieval logic
- Integrate with existing MCP infrastructure

**Phase 3: Agent System (Week 3)**
- Create synthetic representative agent base class
- Implement individual persona agents
- Build agent factory and management

**Phase 4: Evaluation Framework (Week 4)**
- Implement governance evaluation system
- Create scoring and report generation
- Build API endpoints

**Phase 5: Integration & Testing (Week 5)**
- Full system integration
- Comprehensive testing
- Performance optimization
- Documentation

### Alternative: Monolithic Approach

**When Monolithic Might Work:**
- If the development team is very experienced with the codebase
- If there's a tight deadline requiring parallel development
- If the components are well-understood and low-risk

**Risks of Monolithic Approach:**
- Higher chance of integration failures
- Difficult to test individual components
- Harder to debug when things go wrong
- May require significant refactoring if issues are discovered late

## Recommendation

**Use the Phased Approach** because:

1. The system is complex with multiple new components
2. There are clear dependencies between phases
3. Each phase can be validated independently
4. It reduces overall project risk
5. It allows for iterative improvement and feedback

The phased approach will result in a more robust, well-tested system that's easier to maintain and extend in the future.
