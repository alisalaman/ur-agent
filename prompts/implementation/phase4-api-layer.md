   - Set up FastAPI application with proper configuration

2. **Sessions API Implementation**
   - Create src/ai_agent/api/v1/sessions.py with complete Sessions API from Section 6
   - Implement all CRUD operations: create, read, update, delete sessions
   - Add bulk operations: bulk-create and bulk-delete endpoints
   - Include pagination, filtering, and sorting capabilities
   - Add proper query parameter validation and response models

3. **Messages API Implementation**
   - Create src/ai_agent/api/v1/messages.py with complete Messages API
   - Implement message CRUD operations with session association
   - Add message filtering by role and content search
   - Include message threading and parent-child relationships
   - Add pagination for message lists

4. **Agents API Implementation**
   - Create src/ai_agent/api/v1/agents.py with complete Agents API from Section 6
   - Implement agent CRUD operations and configuration management
   - Add agent execution endpoints with streaming support
   - Include agent status filtering and search capabilities
   - Add agent execution history and metrics

5. **Additional API Endpoints**
   - Create src/ai_agent/api/v1/tools.py for tool management
   - Create src/ai_agent/api/v1/mcp_servers.py for MCP server management
   - Create src/ai_agent/api/v1/health.py for system health checks
   - Include administration and monitoring endpoints

6. **Error Handling and Validation**
   - Implement standardized error response classes from Section 6
   - Create global exception handlers for all custom exceptions
   - Add validation error handling with detailed field information
   - Include correlation ID tracking for request tracing

7. **Rate Limiting Implementation**
   - Implement rate limiting with slowapi exactly as specified in Section 6
   - Add endpoint-specific rate limits (create vs read operations)
   - Include user-tier based rate limiting (default, authenticated, premium)
   - Add rate limit exceeded handling and retry-after headers

8. **OpenAPI Configuration**
   - Implement custom OpenAPI configuration from Section 6
   - Add comprehensive API documentation with examples
   - Include security schemes (API key and JWT authentication)
   - Add common response schemas and error documentation

### Exact Specifications:

- Use the complete FastAPI endpoint code from Section 6
- Implement all query parameters, validation, and response models exactly as shown
- Include bulk operations and streaming endpoints as specified
- Match the error handling and exception handlers precisely
- Implement rate limiting decorators exactly as demonstrated
- Follow the OpenAPI configuration exactly as provided

### API Design Requirements:

- **RESTful Design**: Follow REST principles with clear resource-based URLs
- **Consistent Patterns**: Uniform response formats and error handling
- **API Versioning**: Version via URL path (/api/v1/)
- **Pagination**: Cursor-based pagination for large datasets
- **Filtering & Sorting**: Query parameter-based filtering and sorting
- **Bulk Operations**: Support for efficient batch operations
- **Rate Limiting**: Per-endpoint and per-user rate limiting

### Expected Output:

Complete REST API matching Section 6 specifications with:
- All CRUD endpoints for core entities (sessions, messages, agents)
- Comprehensive error handling with standardized responses
- Rate limiting with configurable limits per endpoint
- OpenAPI documentation with examples and security schemes
- Bulk operations for efficient data manipulation
- Streaming support for real-time agent execution

## Phase 4.2: WebSocket Real-Time System

**Goal**: Implement WebSocket support for real-time communication, event streaming, and live agent execution updates.

**Reference Document**: @ai-agent-architecture-plan.md

### Reference Sections:
- Section 2: Project Structure - api/websocket/ directory structure

   - Create connection lifecycle management (connect, disconnect, heartbeat)

2. **Real-Time Event System**
   - Implement event broadcasting system with pub/sub capabilities
   - Create event routing and filtering based on user permissions
   - Add event serialization and deserialization
   - Include event acknowledgment and delivery confirmation

3. **Connection Management**
   - Implement connection state tracking and recovery strategies
   - Add connection heartbeat and health monitoring
   - Create graceful connection handling during deployments
   - Include connection scaling support for horizontal deployment

4. **Agent Execution Streaming**
