# Phase 3: Resilience Layer

## Phase 3.1: Retry & Circuit Breaker Implementation

**Goal**: Implement comprehensive resilience patterns with retry logic, circuit breakers, and health checking for external service integration.

**Reference Document**: @ai-agent-architecture-plan.md

### Reference Sections:
- Section 7: Resilience Architecture - Circuit Breaker State Management
- Section 7: Retry Strategy Implementation (complete Python code)
- Section 7: Circuit Breaker Implementation (complete Python code)
- Section 7: External Service Integration Patterns

### Implementation Tasks:

1. **Retry Management System**
   - Create src/ai_agent/resilience/retry/ directory structure
   - Implement RetryManager class from Section 7 with tenacity integration
   - Create service-specific retry decorators (LLM, Database, MCP)
   - Add exponential backoff with jitter configuration
   - Include comprehensive logging with correlation IDs

2. **Circuit Breaker Implementation**
   - Create src/ai_agent/resilience/circuit_breaker/ directory structure
   - Implement CircuitBreaker class with state management from Section 7
   - Create CircuitBreakerManager for multiple services
   - Add metrics collection (success/failure counts, timing)
   - Implement state transitions: Closed → Open → Half-Open

3. **Health Checking System**
   - Create src/ai_agent/resilience/health/ directory structure
   - Implement health checkers for all external services
   - Add periodic health monitoring with configurable intervals
   - Create health status aggregation and reporting
   - Include dependency health validation

4. **Fallback Strategies**
   - Create src/ai_agent/resilience/fallback/ directory structure
   - Implement graceful degradation patterns
   - Add fallback response handlers for each service type
   - Create service-specific fallback strategies
   - Include fallback response caching

5. **Rate Limiting**
   - Create src/ai_agent/resilience/rate_limiting/ directory structure
   - Implement rate limiters for external services
   - Add token bucket and sliding window algorithms
   - Include rate limit configuration per service
   - Create rate limit metrics and monitoring

6. **Integration Decorators and Patterns**
   - Create decorator combinations for retry + circuit breaker
   - Implement service-specific resilience decorators
   - Add usage examples for each external service type
   - Include configuration-driven decorator selection

### Exact Specifications:

- Use the complete Python code from Section 7 Retry Strategy Implementation
- Implement the full CircuitBreaker class exactly as shown
- Include all state management logic and metrics collection
- Match the retry configurations for each service type (LLM, DB, MCP)
- Implement decorators and usage patterns exactly as specified
- Follow the circuit breaker state diagram transitions precisely

### Circuit Breaker State Management:

Implement the state transitions as shown in the Mermaid diagram:
- **Closed State**: Normal operation with failure counting
- **Open State**: Block requests and wait for recovery timeout
- **Half-Open State**: Test with limited requests

### Expected Output:

Complete resilience layer matching Section 7 specifications with:
- Functional retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Circuit breakers with proper state management
- Health checking system for all external dependencies
- Fallback strategies for graceful degradation
- Rate limiting for external service protection
- Integration decorators ready for use in service layer

**Reference Document**: @ai-agent-architecture-plan.md

### Reference Sections:
- Section 7: External Service Integration Patterns
- Section 2: Project Structure - infrastructure/ directory organization
- Section 4: Configuration Strategy - service-specific settings

### Implementation Tasks:

1. **External Service Base Classes**
   - Create src/ai_agent/infrastructure/base.py with common interfaces
   - Implement ExternalServiceClient base class
   - Add common patterns for authentication and error handling
   - Include health checking integration points

2. **Service Registry Pattern**

   - Add error correlation and tracking
   - Include error metrics collection

5. **Integration Testing Framework**
   - Create mock external services for testing

### Expected Output:

Foundation for external service integration with:
- Base classes for all external service clients
- Resilience patterns ready for application
- Service registry and discovery patterns
- Error classification and handling framework
- Testing infrastructure for resilience validation
