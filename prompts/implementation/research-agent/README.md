# Synthetic Representative AI Agent Framework - Implementation Plan

This directory contains the comprehensive implementation plan for enhancing the AI agent framework with MCP servers to handle synthetic representative functionality for governance model evaluation.

## Overview

The implementation plan is divided into 7 phases, each building upon the previous phases to create a complete system where AI agents can embody stakeholder personas and query transcript data to provide evidence-based responses.

## Phase Structure

### Phase 1: Transcript Ingestion System
- **File**: `phase1-transcript-ingestion.md`
- **Purpose**: Parse and process DOCX transcript files into a searchable knowledge base
- **Key Components**: Document processing, vector embeddings, stakeholder categorization
- **Dependencies**: None (foundation phase)

### Phase 2: Stakeholder Views MCP Server
- **File**: `phase2-stakeholder-views-mcp-server.md`
- **Purpose**: Create MCP server that provides `get_stakeholder_views` tool
- **Key Components**: MCP server implementation, semantic search, evidence extraction
- **Dependencies**: Phase 1 (transcript knowledge base)

### Phase 3: Synthetic Agent System
- **File**: `phase3-synthetic-agent-system.md`
- **Purpose**: Implement synthetic representative agents with distinct personas
- **Key Components**: Agent personas, evidence-based responses, tool integration
- **Dependencies**: Phase 2 (MCP server)

### Phase 4: Governance Evaluation Framework
- **File**: `phase4-governance-evaluation.md`
- **Purpose**: Create structured evaluation system for governance models
- **Key Components**: Multi-agent coordination, scoring system, report generation
- **Dependencies**: Phase 3 (synthetic agents)

### Phase 5: API Integration
- **File**: `phase5-api-integration.md`
- **Purpose**: Build REST API and WebSocket support for the system
- **Key Components**: API endpoints, real-time communication, web interface
- **Dependencies**: Phase 4 (evaluation framework)

### Phase 6: Configuration and Deployment
- **File**: `phase6-configuration-deployment.md`
- **Purpose**: Implement production-ready deployment and configuration
- **Key Components**: Docker containerization, monitoring, CI/CD pipeline
- **Dependencies**: Phase 5 (API integration)

### Phase 7: Testing and Validation
- **File**: `phase7-testing-validation.md`
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive testing and validation of the entire system
- **Key Components**: Unit tests, integration tests, performance tests, validation
- **Dependencies**: All previous phases

## Implementation Approach

### Recommended Strategy: Phased Implementation

The plan is designed for **phased implementation** rather than monolithic development because:

1. **Complexity Management**: Each phase has clear dependencies and can be validated independently
2. **Risk Mitigation**: Early identification of issues and course correction
3. **Incremental Value**: Each phase delivers working functionality
4. **Testing and Validation**: Each component can be thoroughly tested before integration

### Phase Dependencies

```
Phase 1 (Transcript Ingestion)
    ↓
Phase 2 (MCP Server) ← Depends on Phase 1
    ↓
Phase 3 (Synthetic Agents) ← Depends on Phase 2
    ↓
Phase 4 (Evaluation Framework) ← Depends on Phase 3
    ↓
Phase 5 (API Integration) ← Depends on Phase 4
    ↓
Phase 6 (Configuration & Deployment) ← Depends on Phase 5
    ↓
Phase 7 (Testing & Validation) ← Depends on all phases
```
